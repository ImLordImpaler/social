# Social Media API Development Assignment

## Objective
Design and implement a RESTful API for a social media platform using Django Rest Framework. The API should provide endpoints for users to perform various actions such as registration, authentication, posting updates, following other users, liking and commenting on posts, and messaging.

## Functionalities

1. **User Authentication:**
   - User registration: Allow users to register by providing a username, email, and password.
   - User login: Authenticate users using their credentials and provide access tokens for authorization.
   - User profile: Enable users to view and edit their profile information.

2. **Post Management:**
   - Create post: Allow users to create new posts with text content and optional media attachments (images, videos).
   - Edit post: Enable users to edit their own posts.
   - Delete post: Allow users to delete their own posts.

3. **Interaction with Posts:**
   - Like post: Allow users to like/unlike posts.
   - Comment on post: Enable users to add comments to posts.
   - View post details: Provide endpoints to retrieve detailed information about a post including likes, comments, and author details.

4. **User Connections:**
   - Follow user: Allow users to follow/unfollow other users.
   - View followers/following: Provide endpoints for users to view their followers and the users they are following.

5. **Messaging:**
   - Send message: Enable users to send direct messages to other users.
   - View messages: Allow users to view their conversations and messages.

6. **Notifications:**
   - Notify users about new followers, likes, comments, and messages.
   - Provide endpoints for users to view their notifications.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Django Rest Framework Setup:**
   - Set up Django Rest Framework for building the API.
   - Configure authentication classes for user registration and token-based authentication.

2. **Database Models:**
   - Define models for users, posts, comments, likes, follows, messages, and notifications.
   - Implement relationships between models (e.g., users following other users, posts belonging to users).

3. **Serializers and Views:**
   - Create serializers for converting model instances to JSON format.
   - Implement views for handling API endpoints and performing CRUD operations on resources.

4. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement token-based authentication for API endpoints.
   - Ensure proper authorization checks to restrict actions based on user permissions.

5. **Validation and Error Handling:**
   - Validate input data received from clients.
   - Implement error handling to return meaningful error messages in case of validation or other errors.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Document API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Django Rest Swagger.
   - Provide clear documentation on how to authenticate and use the API endpoints.

## Submission Requirements

1. GitHub repository containing the source code of the project.
2. README file with instructions on setting up and running the project locally.
3. Documentation detailing the API endpoints, authentication process, and usage examples.
4. Demonstration of the API functionality through screenshots or video recordings.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Functionality:** Does the API provide all the required functionalities specified in the assignment?
2. **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and following best practices?
3. **Authentication and Authorization:** Is authentication properly implemented? Are authorization checks in place?
4. **Validation and Error Handling:** Are input data validated? Is error handling implemented effectively?
5. **Documentation:** Is the API well-documented with clear instructions for usage?
6. **Overall Design:** Does the API design meet the requirements and demonstrate understanding of RESTful principles?

## Additional Notes

- You are encouraged to use third-party packages for additional functionalities (e.g., Django Rest Framework extensions for pagination, filtering).
- Consider scalability and performance optimization techniques while designing the API.
